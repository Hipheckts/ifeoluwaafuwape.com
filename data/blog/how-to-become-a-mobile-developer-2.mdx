Having establised that a mobile app developer designs, develops, and collaborate with user experience designers to ensure they align the app design to consumers' needs. They also work with business leaders to help them launch the app in the market.

## Choose a learning path

When a subject is cumulative, meticulous attention must be paid when choose a course curriculum or learning path. With that said, don’t choose a language for its ranking; choose a language for which you have a complete learning path that makes no assumptions about prior knowledge.

These are good ways to start.

- What do I want to learn programming for — career or general knowledge?
- If a career is your choice, decide what kind of company you want to work for.
- What coding language is in use in this kind of company?
- How popular is it in other fields?
- Are there enough resources to learn that language?
- How long has the language been around? How many well-known projects have been built on it?

## Choose a platform and stack

The complete technology stack for mobile application development can be divided into four areas. And these are also the areas that also constitute the anatomy of an application. 

Here are the four components which together make one Technology Stack –

- Frontend Development – The interface on which users interact with the mobile app

- Backend Development – The part which takes the user input, processes it, and convert it into an output

- Development Platform – The place where interfaces and libraries come into the picture to design and develop the mobile application. 

- Additional – The technology elements that affect app performance, security, and robustness. 


Now that you know what is a tech stack, let us now look into the reasons why it is important to consider which platform or stack you'd be working with as we have the following:


# Android Tech Stack

- Programming Languages: Kotlin and Java
Although Kotlin is the official programming language for Android app development, Java language is still used to a great extent by many android app development company. The popularity that Java sees makes it one of the best technology stack used by a mobile application development company.

- Toolkit: Android Developer Tools & Android Studio
Android Studio gives developers the feasibility of editing code, debugging, flexible build system, performance tooling, and an instant deploy system. 

- Android SDK
In order to write programs with the latest features, the developers are made to download and then install each version SDK for a specific phone.

# iOS Tech Stack

- Programming Languages: Swift and Objective-C
The most preferred languages that find themselves being a part of the iOS mobile app development technologies are Swift and Objective-C. 

Objective-C being the superset of C language provides a dynamic runtime environment and object-oriented capabilities. 

- Toolkit: Toolkits are the full feature environment that allows one to create both mobile and desktop apps. The ones that are most commonly used by the iPad and iPhone app developers are IntelliJ AppCode and Apple Xcode.

- iOS SDK
The iOS SDK consists of an API which acts as the link between platforms that they run on and the software application. The iPhone SDK offers tools used for Apple’s touchscreen interface and for the proprietary iOS operating system. 

# Hybrid App Technology  Stack

Hybrid apps are usually developed with the help of the standard web techniques like CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript. They usually consist of two sections – Backend and Native shell. These apps can run on all platforms and tend to provide access to API and acquire device storage and a camera etc. 


# Cross-Platform App Tech Stack

Cross-platform app development means using the same code to develop apps that would then run on multiple platforms – Android, iOS, and Web.

Businesses usually go with the cross-platform app development because of the simple fact that they are able to operate around a greater demographic. All the while taking advantage of the low development cost and faster go to market time. 


## Refine your coding skills
Once you have made a decision on the above, then your next steps will be to brush up your coding skills... If you would be following my upcoming series, I would be putting up different contents on mobile development from Beginner to Intermdediate level (specifically on cross platform with Flutter and React Native).

But you can fastrack your growth from any of the following:

## Take on Projects

I will always say the best way to learn is to practice with real life projects and my advise will always be for every learning you do, take on a project to make it stick!.

You can go on github.com, there are tonnes of projects you can fork out and try to rebuild or even on Youtube follow channels that shows you hands-on development or clones of different mobile applications and by so doing you'd be doing yourself a great favour of industry-standard understanding and mastery of many things.
